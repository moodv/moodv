# Hi, I'm Mahmoud ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science graduate who enjoys building things with data and code.  
Iâ€™ve worked on projects ranging from automating sensor calibration with Python to creating a smart healthcare recommendation system using AI.  

These days, Iâ€™m focusing on data analysis and engineering, expanding my portfolio with projects that turn raw data into useful insights.  
I mostly work with Python, SQL, and Power BI, but I like exploring anything that helps me solve problems better.  

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for job opportunities where I can grow, gain experience, and keep improving.  
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m interested in real-world challenges that push me to think and solve problems with data.
